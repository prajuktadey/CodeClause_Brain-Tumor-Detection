1. Task Given: How many times has it occurred to you that even after seeing, you 
don't remember the name of the color? There can be 16 million colors based 
on the different RGB color values but we only remember a few. So in this project, 
we are going to build an interactive app that will detect the selected color from any image. To implement this we will need a labeled data of all the known. 
colors then we will calculate which color resembles the most with the selected 
color value. 


2. Task Given: There are many famous deep learning projects on MRI scan 
dataset. One of them is Brain Tumor detection. You can use transfer learning 
on these MRI scans to get the required features for classification. Or you can 
train your own convolution neural network from scratch to detect brain tumors. 

Used the Python library opendatasets to download the kaggle dataset on MRI scans.
