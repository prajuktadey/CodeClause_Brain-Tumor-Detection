# CodeClause_Brain-Tumor-Detection

Description- There are many famous deep learning projects on MRI scan 
dataset. One of them is Brain Tumor detection. You can use transfer learning 
on these MRI scans to get the required features for classification. Or you can 
train your own convolution neural network from scratch to detect brain tumors. 

Used the Python library opendatasets to download the kaggle dataset on MRI scans.
